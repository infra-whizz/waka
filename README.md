# Waka Image Baker

Image assembler ("waka" - blaze, burning fire in Swahili) is here to create image appliances, using configuration management software design principles.

Features (most TODO :wink:):

- Designed to build multiple platforms (Linux, *BSD, Solaris etc)
- Designed primarily for embedded development (but not limited to)
- Built on top of Whizz configuration management system
- Utilising any standard Ansible modules on demand vis Whizz DSL (YAML and Python dialect)
- Straightforward configuration
- Allows to tweak/configure literally everything
- Extensible by whatever Ansible-style module (binary or Python)
